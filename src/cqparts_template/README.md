# `cqparts` library template

This is a library template intended to be copied then modified to contain your
created components.

This library has a number of examples intended to illustrate the following:

* End user buildable components
    * `Part` and `Assembly` classes
    * Registration with `cqparts.search` [optional]
* Intermediate sub-components used for building
    * `Part` and `Assembly` classes prefixed with `_`
* Sphinx documentation practices
* Creating a `Catalogue` of your component variants.

# Steps to Creating a New Library

The following steps should give you an idea of how to proceed:

1. **Copy**: Make a copy of this folder, and re-name it to
   `cqparts_<your-lib-name>`.
1. **Create**: Create your _components_.
1. **TODO**: search for occurrences of `TODO`, and address each item.
1. **`README.md`**: `TODO`: remember to rename `README.tmp.md` to `README.md`,
   replacing this file.
